# git-branching-practice

This project contains some experimental work implemented in a fun way via a trivia game. Aim: understand basic concepts of 'git merge' and 'git branch'

Part 1
Introduction
Use this document as a starting point for Part 1 of the Class 6 exercise.

As part of this exercise you will create a series of 'trivia questions' and add them to this document. You will also provide an answer for each of the questions on a dedicated branch. Each branch must only contain the answer for the corresponding question (although it may also contain the other questions). See below for an example.

This question would appear on the master branch.


	Q. What is the largest planet in the solar system?
	The same question and the answer would appear on the dedicated 'answer branch'.
